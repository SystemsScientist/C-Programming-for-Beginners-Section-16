--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further Topics of Study I

	- more on data types

		+ defining your own types (typedef)

	- more on the preprocessor

	- more on void*'s 

	- static libraries and shared objects

	- macros

	- unions


Further Topics of Study II

	- function pointers

	- advanced pointers

	- variable arguments to functions (variadic functions)

	- dynamic linking (dim_open)

	- signals, forking and inter-process communication

	- threading and concurrency

	- sockets


Further Topics of Study III

	- setjmp and longjmp for restoring state

	- more on memory management and fragmentation

	- more on making your program portable

	- interfacing with kernel modules (drivers and
	  input/output controls, ioctl)

	- more on compiler and linker flags


Further Topics of Study IV
